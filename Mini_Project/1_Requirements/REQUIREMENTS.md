## 5.HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS

   1. Creating a board 
   
   2. Creating a snake
   
   3. Creating a target
    
   4. Moving the snake
   
## 6.LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS

   1. Create borders 
   
   2. Create coordinates for snake body 

   3. Create multiple coordinate axes
   
   4. Generate scores of players
## FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

  WASD keys for W-Up, A-Left, S-Down, D-Right change the snake's
  direction. The sake has a velocity in the direction it is moving. That
  velocity increases with time. (Provide function of time for detailed
  requirement.) Randomly place power-ups: Slow snake velocity. Food makes
  the snake longer. Bonus targets gain bonus points. etc. If the sake
  collides with the snake the round ends and a new round starts. At the
  end of rounds, the score is registered as the player’s highest if it is
  better than any recorded before. The highest registered score is tracked
  between all players on a leaderboard. Log in to identify the player.
 (Details should include username/password requirements, is two-factor
  auth needed, should obscene words be allowed as usernames? etc..?)
  Options menu to set music and sound effects volumes. Color scheme?

## NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

 On cutting-edge computers, as of 2010, it should get a 40 FPS refresh
 rate. The leaderboard needs to support 9 million concurrent users. The
 leaderboard must be updated within 2 min after a new high score is
 registered by a play. This is the idea. For real game development
 documentation, you would also want some discussion about monetization
 and promotion. You would want some details about the look and feel. (Is
 it neon colors, does it use a disco beat to the music/effects, should be
 it slower and more casual or fast and intense? Etc…)

 A good game design document is more than requirements. But, the
 requirements are a major part of it. Functional requirements are about
 what it should do. Non-Functional requirements are about how well it
 should perform on which platforms.
